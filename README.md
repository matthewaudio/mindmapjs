# mindmapjs
Mind Mapping software in Javascript.  This is meant to be expanded.  I'd like to add a small format editor for nodes that includes text size, stroke style and fill style.  Same for links.  I'd also like to add json import and export which should be fairly easy as I've kept the editor separate from the document.


Tools:

s key : select tool
c key : create node tool
l key : create link tool (click first, then second nodes)
m key : move node tool
e key : edit node text tool

Extra Keys
delete : deletes selected nodes.
